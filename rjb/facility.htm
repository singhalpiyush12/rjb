    <div class="info"><h1>Canteen Facility</h1><hr>
    <p> RJB canteen is the place where one can fulfill his appetite according to his wish. It caters to a variety of food items, which include Maggie, poha, coffee, milk, cold-drinks etc, along with packaged food stuffs and beverages, against cash payments. Besides the food, canteen is also a popular hangout place for the Bhawan inmates. The timings of the canteen best suits the schedule of students. It is open from 11 in morning to 2 at midnight.<br><br>
    During the exams when most of the students avoid going out of the campus to save their so called precious time, canteen remains as their favourite destination for refreshments.Prices of the canteen food-stuff are fixed by chief warden, so that the RJBians could enjoy every bite at nominal price. The canteen is privatized and the contracts are awarded on tender basis.</p></div>

    <div class="info"><h1>TV ROOM</h1><hr>
    <p>After encountering lectures,tutorials, practicals and meetings for maximum part of a day, the mind craves for some relaxation and entertainment.Those who wish to play outdoor games run towards the fields. Some run towards the lappies and some go out on a voyage with a pendrive to collect the new movies and the games for the sake of increasing their collection.There is also a bunch who utilize their time by taking short naps in installment.For the rest,the only place they can love is RJB TV Room.With the ultimate HDTV and Tata sky DTH connectivity its the noisiest place on matchdays. The symbolic howling of the students easily convey the fours and sixes to whole bhawan.<br><br>
     The TV Room also has the ambient facilities for some indoor games like table tennis, carrom and chess.There are 3 table tennis tables. Anyone willing to play TT should bring his own TT bat as its not provided by the institute.<br><br>
    TV Room opens at 6pm and closes at 12 midnight but it can be opened anytime by submitting ID cards which can be taken back after returning the key. There is 1 TV Room attendant to look after it.</p></div>
